    Autouse, because forgetting it is not a test failure — it is a write into
    the developer's real ``~/.claude-launcher``. ``claunch install`` seeds the
    shared workflow layer there, so a test that installs without this fixture
    quietly edits the machine it is running on, and then passes.
